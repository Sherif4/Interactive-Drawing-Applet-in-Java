                                     Interactive Drawing Applet in Java

Description:
🚀 Excited to share my latest Java project – an interactive drawing applet! 🎨✨

I've developed a versatile drawing application using Java's Applet framework. This applet allows users to create and manipulate various shapes, including rectangles, ovals, lines, brushes, and even an eraser, with a dynamic color palette.

Key Features:

🖌️ Brush Tool: Express your creativity with a customizable brush tool, complete with adjustable thickness.

📐 Shape Drawing: Easily create rectangles, ovals, and lines with a user-friendly interface.

⚡ Undo/Redo Functionality: Mistakes happen! Undo and redo actions effortlessly with built-in functionality.

🌈 Color Options: Choose from a vibrant color palette, including red, green, and blue, to bring your drawings to life.

☑️ Solid Fill Option: Toggle between solid and outlined shapes for added versatility.

🔄 Clear All: Start fresh with a single click using the "Clear All" button.

The project also features a unique eraser tool, providing a dynamic experience for users to erase specific areas with precision. The applet keeps track of each drawing step, allowing users to undo and redo their actions seamlessly.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Java developer, this project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore graphical user interface (GUI) programming and event handling in Java.

Feel free to check out the code on GitHub [insert GitHub link] and experiment with the applet. I welcome feedback and collaboration to enhance this drawing application further!
